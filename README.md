# TomoCodes

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal [site and blog](https://tomo.codes), all powered by Swift and the awesome [Ignite static site generator](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite).

## Whatâ€™s this?
- Iâ€™m Tomasz Lizer, and this is my little corner of the internet.
- I write about Swift, Xcode, productivity tricks, and whatever else I find cool or useful.
- I do code in Swift, hence this page is also written in Swift :)


If youâ€™re a Swift dev (or just curious), poke around! Maybe youâ€™ll find something handy â€” or at least see how far you can push Swift outside of iOS apps.
